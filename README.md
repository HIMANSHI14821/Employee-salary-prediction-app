# 🧠 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

A Streamlit-based web application that predicts employee salaries based on user-provided features 
such as education level, gender, workclass, country, occupation, and age.
Built using Python and trained with scikit-learn’s Random Forest Regressor.


## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to estimate salaries based on demographic and professional details. It includes:

- A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.
- A trained Random Forest model for robust predictions.
- Input features such as education, gender, age, and more.
- Easy deployment through Streamlit Cloud.
